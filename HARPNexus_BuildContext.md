# HARP Nexus / Life AI OS Build Context

Purpose: React + Vite-based interface for Life AI OS (the app users interact with).

This repo will include:
- `/src/pages` for primary modules (Home, BibleStudy, FileViewer, etc.)
- `/src/components/chat` for Ezra chat UI
- Shadcn-UI + Lucide-React components
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Routing handled by React Router 6
- Google Cloud Run backend: HARP Nexus API (`/api/ezra` and related endpoints)

Copilot Goal:
Generate boilerplate, connect imported pages, and ensure build pipeline runs with Vite + Tailwind.
